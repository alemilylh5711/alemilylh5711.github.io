### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorite because it was the first I ever use C++. I was able to write functions for the first time and getting a feel for what would come next. Though it was the easiters it helpped me understand int main, std::cout, and return 0.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it showed me that there are time you have to include libraries of the code or function you maybe using. It was my first time inputting math in code. This lab was fun because after finishing the program you were able to see if it worked; it gave you what you prompt it to do which was the diameter and price of a pizza result to the Unit Price.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I finially was able to find out how the game Blackjacks works. Since it was a mini game it required the input a "guess" of a number. It then ask for the second user to input their guess. This lab helped me understand the make file in how they are used.
